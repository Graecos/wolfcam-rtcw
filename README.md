# wolfcam-rtcw

This RTCW mod is a modification of the wolfcam 0.0.5 RTCW mod from Brugal. I've made these changes for myself for my upcoming RTCW history movie. I use this mod combined with the RTCW demo analyzer, which is also available on my GitHub account.

# Context
There are a lot of different moviemods or viewing mods for RTCW such as: wolfcam, uvMovieMod, Demoviewer and Viewpoint are the most known ones. However, all these mods have their strenghts, weaknesses and limitations. I only want to use 1 mod for all RTCW versions with all features "One RTCW moviemod to rule them all".

# Changes Made:
- Obituaries ("Player1 killed Player2 with MP40") support for older RTCW versions 1.0 and 1.3x (protocol 57, 58 and 59)
- Added uvMovieMod and Demoviewer features
- Added some own made features

# Commands implemented:

### Wolfcam 0.0.5:
- /players - to get a list of players and client ids
- /follow [clientid] - follow selected client. /follow -1 follows original demo POV
- /wolfcam_avoidDemoPov [0/1] - avoids trying to follow demo POV
- /wolfcam_tryToStickWithTeam [0/1] - tries to stick with team of demo POV
- /wolfcam_wh [0/1] - activates a wallhack, but isn't perfectly implemented
